# EO Colon Cancer Trends using CI5plus Data

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores **early-onset colon cancer incidence trends** using data from **CI5plus** (Cancer Incidence in Five Continents).  Recent studies have raised concern about increasing rates of **early-onset colon cancer** (diagnoses before age 50).  This project investigates whether these trends represent a **true epidemiological shift** or mirror broader changes across all age groups.It forms part of a wider research effort into global cancer trends and contextual risk factors.

The notebook(s) in this repository focus on:
- Extracting and preparing CI5plus colon cancer incidence data
- Analyzing age-specific and early-onset (under 50 years) trends
- Comparing across countries/registries
- Building a foundation for subsequent analyses (breast, lung, prostate cancers)

## âœ¨ Next Steps

- Expand analysis to include other cancers (breast, lung, prostate).
- Integrate contextual country-level data (HDI, screening availability).
- Prepare manuscript-style outputs for academic submission.
